I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
that my professor provided to complete my project milestones.

I enjoyed working on milestone 1 of the final project because we are creating an interactive menu. It was fun creating the actual menu itself via printf and creating a switch loop to call each of the menu selections. As with working on the workshops, I found myself still making a lot of syntax errors which I had to fix by learning to read and understand the error codes. I had some issues with the getIntMM function initially because I did not pass the arguments correctly. I had the correct arguments for getIntMM under default of the switch loop but did not think I needed them when setting the variable selection. I am unsure of the purpose of creating POS.h but there was a value check in main.c. I assume these values may be used in the future milestones for calculations or changes.
