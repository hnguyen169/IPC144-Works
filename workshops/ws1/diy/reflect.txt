//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Working on workshop #1 has helped me become more comfortable with programming in Visual Studios in C language, using git to push and pull repositories, and compiling, testing, and submitting files on Matrix. To program in Visual Studios, I learned to create an empty C++ project and how to change it C instead of C++, by adding a source file with the extention ".c". For coding in C, I learned to introduce functions ( void title(void); ), then call them under a main function ( int main(void) { title(); ...} ), and add what they do ( void title(void)  { printf("IPC144 NBB\tWorkshop 1\tPart 1\n"); } ). Learning about scanf in class, I understood that it does not print anything. Scanf reads what you tell it to, and puts the number in a specified address. In the diy section, I had to recall learning in class that math is done left to right regardless of operation unless the math is in parenthesis. I used TortoiseGit to pull "IPC144NBB-ONLY-" files from GitHub to my computer and used this opportunity to work offline because I had access to the workshop #1 readme file. I also used TortoseGit to upload my files to GitHub by commiting and pushing. When working on this workshop, I noticed I made a lot of syntax errors in my coding. In part 1 of the workshop, I ran my code without debugging and found six syntax errors all saying I had forgot to add ";" at the end of each line. I think by making these mistakes, it helped me understand the grammar of coding languages more and the attention to detail required. An issue I had in the diy section was the organization of my code. In my first iteration of the code, I did not introduce the "marks" function and instead had all of the code in the main section along with the other functions. I found this disorganized and unappealing to look at, so I introduced a new "marks" function, called it, and had the code for it in a new section not inside the main function.
